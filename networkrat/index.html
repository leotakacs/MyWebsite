<b><p><span style="font-size: 28pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Explaining The Network RAT</span></p></b>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;font-size: 15pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So a lot of people are looking for answers on how my scammer RAT works, and some are also
questioning whether it's real or not. Today I'm going to explain how it works and hopefully answer
some questions.
I will try to update this as much as I can, as I find more questions that people would like answered.
If you'd like me to add something, email me at leotronics10@gmail.com

<h2>Quick QNA: </h2>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<h3>How do we know that the scammer took the file? I didn't see a transfer in GoToAssist</h3>
<li style="">Some versions of GoToAssist allow silent file transfers from the supprt agent's side</li>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default">
<h3>What exploit did your RAT use to infect the entire network? How was it done?</h3>
<li style="">No exploits were used, actually.
Every one of their PC's had their C drive shared, which is a terrible idea as you may know. They also had taken ownership 
of System32 and had UAC disabled, meaning that all I would need to edit files in Sys32 is admin perms. Not that hard to obtain, as the
payment information file simply gave an error if it was not opened as an admin. I got extremely lucky in this case (the video was actaully supposed
to be "Scammer Versus Real Malware", but he took the RAT instead). This is why I've only been able to take down a network of them like this <i>once.</i></li>

<div class="panel panel-default">
<h3>How do we know that this wasn't just a batch file (as it looks like one)? It shows the CMD icon at the top left, and not the console application icon.</h3>
<li style="">Well, you'd be right! The application that you saw is actually just a bat file. Read this:
<pre>
The rat itself is an exe. The bat file uses findstr to parse the output it into a readable format. 
The original output from the RAT is in an ugly json structure which is not
something that casual viewers are going to be able to easily read.﻿
</pre>
<img src="ratisanexe.png">
<pre  style="resize:none;outline:0;text-align:left;white-space: pre-wrap;">/VIRTUAL_C_DRIVE_MOUNT: where their C drive would be mounted (if enabled).

_start.bat: starts the RAT client for a single PC.

_start-all-on-network.bat: starts the RAT but, with the correct parameters to allow multiple connections.

RAT-PROG.EXE: the actual RAT.

settings.bat: an unused settings solution that I came up with (the RAT would run <pre style="display:inline">call settings.bat</pre> to apply it).</pre>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default">
<h3>Why won't you release the source code? Seems fishy.</h3>
<li style="">I understand that the only way to definitively prove the legitimacy of this is to release the source code.
Well, would you give someone $1,000,000 and say "Only buy socks!", and trust that they'd comply? Of course not!
Weird example, but it works here.
Same goes with that RAT. I could in theory give it to anyone who asks (or provide a <a onclick="alert('lol')">download link</a>), and just
<b><i>HOPE</i></b> that they'd only use it against scammers, but we all that it would be abused by a lot of people. It could EASILY be traced
back to me (afterall, it IS called "Leo's Untitled Scammer RAT") if it was used against a legitmate company, service, or person.
If that happens, I could be in serious trouble.
<font color="red">That is not a risk that I am willing to take.</font>
</li>

<div class="panel panel-default">
<h3>What's with those nonsensical file names?</h3>
<img src="filenames.png">
<li style="">This is a totally valid point and I <i>DO</i> understand why people are questioning this one.
The RAT worked by mapping out MY (host) System32's contents, and then attempting to delete those files from the scammer's machine.
Those strange files that you see exists on my host machine for whatever reason (not sure how they got there, but with all the crazy shit I do to
Windows, it doesn't surprise me).
You can also see the <b>Date modified</b> information to prove that I didn't <i>just</i> create those files, as I know that that's coming next.
